Dr. Shannahan was the reason why I was able to recover from my injuries. He truly cares about his patients and takes the time to individualize a treatment plan. His hands-on approach to health care, including patient examination, diagnosis, and treatment, put me on a path to recovery. If it wasn't for him, I don't know how I would have been able to recover. His service was EXCELLENT, and I highly recommend him to anyone.",

I injured myself from a fall and was walking crooked and,after refusing back surgery options, I began another healing route. Dr. Tim, in one visit, helped alleviate some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life. Through more visits, I was slowly but surely able to walk straight again and get out of a crooked mess. Thank you, Dr. Tim and staff, for the hospitality, the dedication, the caring tones in your voices. You all were really there for me when I was experiencing horrible pain. Because of your continued care and a healthy lifestyle, I can walk upright and even run for a while. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
